# Simple_Task_Manager_App
The app is about to add, remove and list tasks from tasks.csv file. It reads a tasks.csv file so you can see all the tasks you wrote down on your list.
The tasks are in format: Task description, deadline, is important or not (true/false).

When you open the app you can add new tasks, you can remove some old tasks and you have the possibility to list the current list of tasks. When you are done you can just choose option "exit" to save you task list and close the app.

Important thing is to have the tasks.csv file in the same folder as your app.
